I specialize in Front-end development, but I'm also considerably exposed to Back-end development and UI/UX. I always aim to get the best out of myself by staying up to date with latest trends and technologies. I'm extremely fascinated by state of the art user interfaces in particular. In my free time, I'm busy with football.
